Here are 5 common C++ sorting algorithms:

Quick Sort:
1)Fast on average, but can be slow in the worst case.
2)Divides the data into smaller parts to sort them.

Merge Sort:
1)Always fast (O(n log n)), but needs extra memory.
2)Splits the data in half, sorts, and then merges.

Heap Sort:
1)Uses a binary heap to sort efficiently.
2)Doesn’t need extra space but isn't as fast as Quick Sort in practice.

Bubble Sort:
1)Very simple, but slow for large datasets (O(n²)).
2)Repeatedly swaps adjacent items if they're in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort:
1)Good for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
2)Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element into the correct position.
